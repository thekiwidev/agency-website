          <h2>How we collect it</h2>
          <p>
            Directly from you (forms, email, scheduling), from your systems we
            integrate with (e.g., GitHub, cloud platforms with your
            authorization), and via cookies/analytics on our site.
          </p>

          <h2>Why we process data (purposes)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide and improve services; scope and deliver projects.</li>

          <h2>Legal bases (if applicable)</h2>
          <p>

            and security commitments from these providers. We do not sell
            personal information. We do not use client source code in other
            client work.
