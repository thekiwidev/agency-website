## Who we are

[Agency] is a US‑registered, remote‑first group of engineers focused on practical outcomes. Our network includes specialists in **Web & Mobile**, **Cyber Security**, **DevOps**, **Embedded Systems**, and **AI/ML**. Many of our engineers are based in **Nigeria**, with senior talent across **North America, Europe, and Africa** to cover time zones and scale quickly.

**What we believe**: Good engineering makes hard things feel simple. Your users do not care about our process—only results. We keep scope sharp, measure impact, and deliver.

---

## Why we exist

Teams stall for predictable reasons: unclear scope, missing skills, risky launches, or operational drag. We provide focused specialists who unblock delivery. You keep ownership and strategy. We handle the **specific work** that gets releases moving again.

**Not the pitch**: No bloat, no opaque retainers, no pressure to commit. **Hourly, transparent, and reversible**. If we are not adding speed or safety, we stop.

---

## How we work

**1) Inquiry** — Share goals, constraints, timeline, and repos or briefs.\
**2) Discovery** — 30–45 minutes to align outcomes and define acceptance criteria.\
**3) Quote** — Role mix, estimated hours, milestones, and start date. Hourly T&M by default.\
**4) Build** — Lead engineer assigned. Weekly demos. PRs in your repos.\
**5) Deliver** — Handover docs, runbooks, and next‑step options (support or retainer).

**Assurances**: NDA on request · Security‑first · Accessibility‑aware · Clear change control · Time tracking shared
